# Java-Graphical-User-Interface

Java provides robust support for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using libraries like Swing,
AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), and JavaFX.

- Swing: A lightweight, platform-independent library for building window-based applications. It includes components like buttons, tables, and trees.
- AWT: A more basic library that interacts directly with the native operating system for GUI components.
- JavaFX: The modern alternative to Swing, offering advanced features like CSS styling, 3D graphics, and media integration.
 
: Features of Java GUI:
- Cross-platform compatibility.
- Event-driven programming model.
- Customizable and extensible components.
